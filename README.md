# representations
This is a psychology experiment with two different similarity judgement tasks. 
You need normal or corrected-to-normal vision. 

It takes around 15 min in total to complete the tasks. 

Please run the **representation_exp.py** file in python for the experiment. 

You need to install **expyriment** module before starting. (Please follow the instructions here: https://docs.expyriment.org/Installation.html)

At the end of the experiment, it will generate a **data** folder with an **xpd** file that you need to send back to me. 

Make sure that the the **python code** file and the **stimuli** folder from the github are all in the same folder.

Thank you so much for your help. <3
